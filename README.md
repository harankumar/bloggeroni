A super simple blogging platform.

Looks for an `index.json` file in the `in` directory and takes each of the posts from it.
Plugs them into the templates, also found in the `in` directory.
Copies all of this over to the `out` directory.

Make of this what you will.

MIT licensed because I seriously doubt anyone is both backhanded enough and bored enough to try to steal this.
